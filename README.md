# Odin Recipes
These are websites showing simple yet delicious recipes, built as part of The Odin Project's HTML Foundations course.

## Technologies used
- Git and GitHub (to manage and keep track of changes made to the code)
- HTML (serves as the foundation of the webpage, defining its structure and content)
- Lists (to organize the information in a structured and readable format)
- Links and images (used to connect to webpages and display visuals on the webpage)
- Commit messages (explains what changes were made and why they were made)

## How the project was built
1. Created a new repo for this project on GitHub and cloned that repository onto my local machine using SSH.
2. Ceated an index.html file and filled it out with the usual HTML boilerplate.
3. Created a new directory with the name "recipes" which hold all the files of the recipes.
5. Structured each recipe webpage using headings for the recipe names; links to connect the webpages; as well as ordered and unordered lists for the recipe ingredients and steps.
6. Added images matching each recipe on its own webpage.
7. Updated README.md file with project details.
